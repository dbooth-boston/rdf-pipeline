This portion of the RDF Pipeline Framework makes use of:

1. joint.js, which is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 
Version 2.0, which is compatible with Apache 2.0:
http://jointjs.com/license
http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/

2. rappid, which has a custom license at:
http://jointjs.com/license/rappid
That license is rather confusing, but it says: "A development license 
is not required in order to build an application that uses the software."
So AFAICT a license is not required for building the RDF Pipeline 
Framework to use rappid.
