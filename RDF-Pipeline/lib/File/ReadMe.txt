This directory a version of File::DirCompare that
was modified to add the "exclude" option, to allow certain files
or directories to be excluded from comparison.
It is used by helpers/compare-results.perl when doing
regression testing.
I (David Booth) emailed the original author the changes, and
hopefully he will roll them into a later version.  But until then,
this version must be used.
